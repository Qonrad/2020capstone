    "Granger 'causality' analysis provides an asymmetric measure of the coupling\n",
    "between two time-series. When discussing this analysis method, we will put the\n",

    "of quotes should be reserved for particular circumstances, often not fulfilled\n",

    "the current value of the time-series. In Granger 'causality' analysis, we test\n",
    "whether the addition of a prediction of the time-series from another\n",
    "time-series through a multivariate auto-regressive model may improve our\n",
